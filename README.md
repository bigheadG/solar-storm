# solar-storm
This Python script fetches data from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and allows for movie playback or image display. It uses the SDO's data files available at https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/assets/img/latest/ or by copying the IP address from the page at https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/data/. The script interacts with the ChatGPT model to receive instructions and execute tasks.

Here's the breakdown of the script's functionality:

1: Fetching Data: The script fetches data from the SDO website using the provided URLs or IP addresses. It retrieves the latest data files available.

2: Displaying Images: It can display individual images from the fetched data files using Python libraries such as matplotlib or PIL.

3: Playing Movies: The script can also play movies by sequentially displaying frames extracted from the fetched data files. It uses OpenCV or a similar library for this purpose.

4: ChatGPT Interaction: The script interacts with ChatGPT to receive instructions on what to do with the fetched data. It can ask ChatGPT for guidance on whether to display images, play movies, or perform any other specific tasks.

5: Running the Script: The script can be copied into an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and executed to fetch data from the SDO website, interact with ChatGPT, and perform the requested tasks.

Overall, this script provides a flexible way to access and visualize data from NASA's SDO, allowing for easy exploration of solar dynamics and phenomena.

Go to https://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/assets/img/latest/ will see all of data files.
